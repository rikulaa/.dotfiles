# Change the color of the kitty window's titlebar on macOS. A value of "system"
# means to use the default system color, a value of "background" means to use
# the background color of the currently active window and finally you can use
# an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or "red". WARNING: This option works by
# using a hack, as there is no proper Cocoa API for it. It sets the background
# color of the entire window and makes the titlebar transparent. As such it is
# incompatible with background_opacity. If you want to use both, you are
# probably better off just hiding the titlebar with macos_hide_titlebar.
