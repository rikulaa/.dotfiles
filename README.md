# Dotfiles
These are my personal configs for bash, zsh, tmux, git, hammerspoon and vim

## Installation
Dependencies: git, brew, stow

1. Run stow to symlink wanted configs. E.g `stow nvim git shell hammerspoon bin ...`.
2. Run setup script

See 'setup'-folder for installation scripts. 
On osx setup-brew must be run first.
Running the installation scripts nukes your previous configuration.

## VS-Code
Download syncing, setup with gist and download settings
